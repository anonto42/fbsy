# FingerBridge (`fbsy`)

Native biometric attendance bridge, packaged as a small **service manager** — connects ZKTeco devices to HRMS via webhook.

Runs on a Windows, Linux, or macOS machine inside the office LAN. The `fbsy` binary installs itself, then starts/stops/monitors long-running **services** by name. The main service, `at-bridge`, pulls attendance from one or more ZKTeco devices over TCP, maps them to HRMS events, and posts them to your webhook URL.

---

## Install

**Linux / macOS** — one line, detects your OS/arch, downloads the right binary, and sets up PATH:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anonto42/fbsy/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows** (PowerShell):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anonto42/fbsy/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then open a new shell and run `fbsy --help`.

The installer honors `FBSY_VERSION` (pin a version), `FBSY_INSTALL_DIR` (custom bin dir), and `FBSY_NO_VERIFY=1` (skip checksum). Prefer to inspect first? Download the script, read it, then run it.

### Manual download

Or grab the binary for your platform from the [Releases](../../releases) page and run `fbsy install` yourself:

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows 64-bit | `fbsy-windows-x86_64.exe` |
| Linux x86\_64 (Debian / Arch / Fedora) | `fbsy-linux-x86_64` |
| Linux ARM64 | `fbsy-linux-aarch64` |
| macOS Intel | `fbsy-macos-intel` |
| macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) | `fbsy-macos-arm64` |

```bash
chmod +x fbsy-linux-x86_64        # Linux/macOS only
./fbsy-linux-x86_64 install       # copies to ~/.local/bin, sets up PATH + data dirs
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Start the bridge — first run launches an interactive setup wizard
fbsy run at-bridge

# 2. Watch everything in a live dashboard (or `fbsy show` for a static snapshot)
fbsy dashboard

# 3. Pull attendance once on demand
fbsy at-bridge sync --once

# 4. Inspect / stop
fbsy logs at-bridge
fbsy close at-bridge
```

`fbsy dashboard` is a full-screen live monitor — ↑/↓ select a service, `s` start, `x` stop, `r` restart, `l` toggle the log pane, `q` quit. See [docs/INSTALL_FLOW.md](docs/INSTALL_FLOW.md) for the full install→run lifecycle.

---

## How it works

`fbsy` manages three **services**, each of which runs as a **detached background process** (it survives closing the terminal) and writes a registry file so `fbsy show`/`dashboard` can track it:

| Service | What it is |
|---|---|
| `at-bridge` | The real bridge — pulls attendance from your devices and forwards to HRMS. This is the one you run in production. |
| `zkteco` | A mock ZKTeco device server (fake attendance) for local testing without hardware. |
| `hrms` | A mock HRMS webhook server that prints what it receives, for local testing. |

`fbsy run <service>` starts one; `fbsy show` / `fbsy dashboard` monitor them; `fbsy close <service>` stops one. Each service also has its own command group (e.g. `fbsy at-bridge sync`, `fbsy zkteco run -p 4370`).

**Everything lives in one per-OS data directory** (created by `fbsy install`):

| OS | Data directory |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/fbsy/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/fbsy/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\fbsy\` |

with `config/config.json`, `logs/<service>.log`, and `run/<service>.json` (the pid/port registry) underneath.

---

## Configuration (`config.json`)

```jsonc
{
  "vpsWebhookUrl": "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/biometric-devices/webhook",
  "bridgePort": 7431,
  "devices": [
    {
      "deviceIp": "192.168.1.100",
      "devicePort": 4370,
      "devicePassword": 0,
      "deviceTimeout": 15,
      "deviceOmitPing": true,
      "deviceCode": "GATE-01",
      "apiKey": "your-webhook-api-key",
      "organizationId": 1,
      "syncIntervalSeconds": 300,
      "clearAttendanceAfterSync": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multiple devices → one HRMS** is the normal case: add more objects to the `devices` array. All devices share the top-level `vpsWebhookUrl`, but each posts with its own `deviceCode` + `apiKey` + `organizationId`, has its own `syncIntervalSeconds`, and syncs on an independent schedule — one offline device never blocks the others. `deviceCode`s must be unique. The setup wizard's "Add another device?" prompt builds this for you.

Optional — enable HRMS job polling (push/pull templates):
```jsonc
{
  "hrmsBaseUrl": "https://app.yourdomain.com/api/v1",
  "hrmsApiToken": "device-token",
  "jobPollIntervalSeconds": 30
}
```

## Command reference

### Install & lifecycle
```bash
fbsy install                 # copy binary to ~/.local/bin, set up PATH + data dirs
fbsy uninstall               # remove the binary (keeps your data dir)
```

### Service management
```bash
fbsy run at-bridge           # start the bridge (wizard on first run)
fbsy run zkteco [-p 4370 --records 5]    # start the mock device
fbsy run hrms   [-p 8800]                # start the mock HRMS
fbsy show                    # table of all services: status / pid / port / uptime
fbsy dashboard               # live full-screen TUI (see below)
fbsy status <service>        # detail for one service
fbsy logs <service> [-n 50] [--follow]   # tail a service's log
fbsy close <service>         # stop a service
```
`<service>` is `at-bridge`, `zkteco`, or `hrms`. Running `fbsy` with no command is the same as `fbsy show`.

### `at-bridge` (the real bridge)
```bash
fbsy at-bridge run [--config PATH --interval N --no-poll]   # same as `fbsy run at-bridge`
fbsy at-bridge sync [--once] [--device GATE-01]             # pull attendance now, then exit
fbsy at-bridge config validate          # validate config.json (exit 0/1)
fbsy at-bridge config show              # print config with secrets redacted
fbsy at-bridge config path              # print the config path fbsy uses
fbsy at-bridge config setup             # (re)run the interactive setup wizard
fbsy at-bridge doctor [--deep] [--json] # readiness; --deep tests live device + webhook
fbsy at-bridge devices list             # list configured devices (no secrets)
fbsy at-bridge devices test GATE-01     # test TCP connection to one device
fbsy at-bridge webhook test GATE-01     # send an empty batch to verify the webhook
```

### Mock servers (local testing)
```bash
fbsy zkteco run [-p 4370 --records 5]   # = fbsy run zkteco
fbsy hrms   run [-p 8800]               # = fbsy run hrms
```

## The live dashboard (`fbsy dashboard`)

A full-screen terminal UI that auto-refreshes and lets you control services without leaving the screen:

```
┌ fbsy  service dashboard ─────────────────────────────┐
│ SERVICE    STATUS   PID    PORT  UPTIME  DESCRIPTION  │
│ at-bridge  running  4821   7431  2m10s   attendance…  │  ← selected row
│ zkteco     running  4830   4370  1m55s   mock device  │
│ hrms       stopped  -      -     -       mock HRMS     │
├ logs: at-bridge (running) ───────────────────────────┤
│ ➡ Received HRMS Event Payload …                       │  ← live tail
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Keys: **↑/↓** (or `j`/`k`) select · **s** start · **x** stop · **r** restart · **l** toggle log pane · **q**/Esc quit. Needs a real terminal (prints a hint if piped).

## at-bridge HTTP API

While `at-bridge` is running it also exposes a local HTTP API on `127.0.0.1:<bridgePort>` (default `7431`):

```
GET  /health                 — agent status, device states, last sync result
POST /sync                   — trigger a sync for all devices
POST /sync?device=GATE-01    — trigger a sync for one device
```

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7431/health
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7431/sync
```

---

## Safety rule

**Attendance records are never cleared from the device unless the HRMS webhook upload fully succeeded.**

`clearAttendanceAfterSync` defaults to `false`. Enable it only after verifying that sync works correctly end-to-end.

---

## How data flows

```
1. Connect to ZKTeco device over TCP (with optional password auth)
2. Query record count via CMD_GET_FREE_SIZES
3. Pull attendance via CMD_PREPARE_BUFFER → CMD_DATA / CMD_PREPARE_DATA chunks
4. Decode records (8-byte, 16-byte, or 40-byte format depending on firmware)
5. Map punch codes → check_in / check_out  (0 or 4 = check_in, else check_out)
6. POST events in 500-record batches to HRMS webhook (retry on 429 / 5xx)
7. If upload succeeded AND clearAttendanceAfterSync = true → CMD_CLEAR_ATTLOG
```

---

## Local testing (no real device needed)

Spin up both mock services, point a config at them, and run a one-shot sync:

```bash
fbsy run hrms                      # mock HRMS webhook on :8800
fbsy run zkteco                    # mock ZKTeco device on :4370

# config.json with vpsWebhookUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8800/webhook
# and a device at deviceIp 127.0.0.1, devicePort 4370
fbsy at-bridge sync --once         # pulls from the mock device, forwards to mock HRMS

fbsy logs hrms                     # see the events the mock HRMS received
fbsy dashboard                     # watch all three services live
fbsy close zkteco && fbsy close hrms
```

---

## Development

Requirements: Rust stable (1.75+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonto42/fbsy
cd fbsy

# Install git hooks (runs fmt + clippy + tests, and auto-bumps the version on every commit)
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh

cargo build
cargo test
cargo run -- show
cargo run -- at-bridge doctor
```

To build a release binary locally:
```bash
cargo build --release
# binary at: target/release/fbsy
```

The pre-commit hook auto-increments the patch version in `Cargo.toml` (skip with `FBSY_NO_BUMP=1`), and GitHub Actions publishes a cross-platform release on every push with a new version — so each push ships binaries automatically.

```

The service model: `fbsy run X` spawns a detached child that re-enters the binary through a hidden `__service-run` subcommand and runs the matching blocking loop (`serve` for the bridge, `test_server` for the mocks). The parent records a registry file and exits; `show`/`dashboard`/`close` operate on that registry plus a live process check.
